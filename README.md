PRIVACY NOTICE
The nature of this project means that it will take pictures of you using your computer's camera. These pictures are sent to a server running on the University of Glasgow server space, where they are fed into the LibreFace model to determine what emotion they convey. Following this, they are deleted. No facial images are stored in permanent storage at any point in the process.
The database logs your username, the URL of the video you have watched and a list of calculated emotions. No other identifiable information is stored and you are free to use false usernames / display names when signing up.
